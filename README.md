# Blockchain Car Pooling System 🚗🔗

## Introduction 🌐

Welcome to the Blockchain Car Pooling System! This system is designed to facilitate car sharing and rental transactions through the power of blockchain technology. Users can deploy a blockchain, add cars to rent, request bookings, and manage transactions securely.

## Code Structure 🧱

The code is organized into several classes, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Block Class**: Represents a block in the blockchain with details such as index, transactions, timestamp, previous hash, and nonce.
2. **Blockchain Class**: Implements the blockchain structure with features like proof of work, adding blocks, and managing transactions.
3. **SmartContract Class**: Defines a smart contract for managing financial transactions and car rental details.
4. **Owner Class**: Represents an owner in the system who can add cars, deploy the blockchain, and handle booking requests.
5. **Customer Class**: Represents a customer who can request car bookings, pass the number of rental days, and access cars.
6. **Car Class**: Represents a car with details such as car info, day price, and rental status.
7. **BookingDetails Class**: Manages the details of a car booking, including the car, price per day, number of days, and rental date.

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Create Owners and Customers**: Users can create owners and customers with unique IDs, each having their own balance in Ether.

2. **Deploy Blockchain**: Owners can deploy the blockchain, initializing the system for secure and transparent transactions.

3. **Add Cars to Rent**: Owners can add cars to the system, specifying car details and daily rental prices.

4. **Request Booking**: Customers can request car bookings, choosing from available cars. Owners can approve or deny requests.

5. **Encrypt and Store Details**: Owners can encrypt and store important details securely in the blockchain.

6. **Withdraw Earnings**: Owners can withdraw their earnings from successful car rentals.

7. **Retrieve Balance**: Customers can retrieve their unwithdrawn earnings from completed bookings.

8. **Exit**: Exit the system when done.
